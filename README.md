# **Power BI, SQL, and Azure Synapse Integration Project**

## **Project Overview**
This project demonstrates the integration of Power BI, SQL, and Azure Synapse Analytics with version control using Git. The objective is to showcase how to manage code, collaborate on data analytics projects, and automate deployment processes using CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps.

## **Project Structure**
- **SQL Scripts:** Contains SQL scripts for creating and managing database objects such as tables, views, and stored procedures.
- **Power BI Reports:** Includes Power BI `.pbix` files and associated M scripts and DAX formulas for data analysis and visualization.
- **Azure Synapse Artifacts:** Contains Azure Synapse SQL pools, notebooks, and pipeline definitions for data processing and analytics.

## **Key Features**
- **Version Control:** All code and resources are managed using Git for version control, ensuring consistency, traceability, and collaboration.
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Automated CI/CD pipelines are set up in Azure DevOps for continuous integration and delivery of SQL scripts and Power BI reports.
- **Collaborative Development:** Multiple contributors can work on different parts of the project, with code reviews and pull requests ensuring code quality.

## **Project Workflow**

1. **Repository Setup:**
   - Created a GitHub repository for managing SQL scripts, Power BI reports, and Azure Synapse artifacts.
   - Cloned the repository locally for development and testing.

2. **SQL Development:**
   - Wrote SQL scripts for database setup, including table creation, views, and stored procedures.
   - Committed and pushed SQL scripts to the repository for version control.

3. **Power BI Integration:**
   - Developed Power BI reports and dashboards, saving `.pbix` files in the repository.
   - Managed Power Query M scripts and DAX formulas as separate files for better versioning.
   - Committed and pushed Power BI resources to the repository.

4. **Azure Synapse Integration:**
   - Linked the Azure Synapse workspace to the GitHub repository for version control.
   - Developed SQL pools, notebooks, and data pipelines within Synapse, committing changes directly to the repository.
   - Pushed Azure Synapse artifacts to the repository for version control.

5. **Branching and Collaboration:**
   - Created feature branches for developing new features or fixing issues.
   - Collaborated with team members using pull requests, ensuring code is reviewed before merging.
   - Merged feature branches into the main branch after successful code reviews and testing.

6. **CI/CD Pipeline Configuration:**
   - Set up CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps for automated testing and deployment of SQL scripts and Power BI reports.
   - Configured pipeline triggers for automatic deployment on code commit to the main branch.
   - Included automated testing steps to validate SQL scripts and Power BI report integrity.

7. **Deployment and Monitoring:**
   - Deployed SQL scripts to Azure SQL Database and Power BI reports to the Power BI Service via the CI/CD pipeline.
   - Monitored deployment status and validated that all components were successfully integrated.

8. **Documentation:**
   - Documented the entire project workflow in this README, detailing each step and its purpose.
   - Updated the README regularly to reflect project progress and changes.
